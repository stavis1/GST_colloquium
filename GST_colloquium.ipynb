        "\n",
        "Hashmaps are data structures that store key value pairs in a way that allows you to very quickly look up a value based on a key. Dictionaries in python are hashmaps which can store any object as a value and can use any hashable object as a key. Sets are specialized hashmaps which only store true or false as values. These can be used to efficiently look up whether or not a key is in the set.\n",
        "\n",
        "A hash is a function that maps objects of arbitrary size and complexity to a finite range of numbers. In the context of a hashmap data structure the finite range represents locations in memory and the hash function calculates where in memory a value is stored based on its key which means that the time it takes to find a value is only dependent on the time it takes to calculate the hash of a key. This contrasts with looking up values in a list which requires iterating over each item in the list until you find what you're looking for, an operation that becomes more expensive on average as the list grows in size.\n",

Hashmap Data Call\" title=\"Figure 1: Accessing Data in a Hashmap\" width=\"440\" hspace=\"20\" vspace=\"10\"> The tradeoff that you have to make with hashmaps is that there are some cases in which two keys have the same hash so their values must be stored in a list and iterated over for lookup. To minimize this problem the range of memory locations needs to be significantly larger than the number of values stored. This means that hash maps will generally be larger in memory than more compact data structures like lists. This is not as much of a problem as it first appears because  Python does not store the actual value at the memory locaiton calculated by the hash function. Instead the memory location it calculates is the index of a list that stores memory addresses which point to where the values are actually stored. This means that each block of memory indexed by the hashmap can be very small while still being able to point to values of arbitrary size. Therefore the memory overhead is only likely to be siginficant if you're storing a large number of small things.\n",

        "Large .xlsx files can be slow to import with pandas. This is because they are actually zipped folders of mostly XML files which need to be decompressed before going through the somewhat inefficient process of XML parsing. This setup gives excel the flexability to store images, graphs, formatting, and functions but, if all you want is a table of data, this flexability comes at significant performance costs. Thus it is generally preferable to store tabular data as a text file (.csv or .tsv) unless you absolutely need to store these   extra types of information.\n",

        "If you have no choice but to use large .xlsx files there is still a faster way to import the data as a pandas dataframe. The xlsx2csv package is sigificantly faster at parsing .xlsx files than pandas. So, what we can do is parse the .xlsx file to an in-memory .csv (meaning that the file is stored only in RAM and not written to our hard drive) then use the very efficient pandas .csv parser to get the data into a dataframe.

The optimizations include single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) steps in which a single operation that would normally be applied serially to values in an array can be applied simultaniously to blocks of 4-8 values. When doing mathematical operations it is therefore best to let numpy handle as much of the processing as possible. This means that we should avoid writing explicit loops or accessing individual values within numpy arrays as much as possible and instead perform operations on whole arrays at once using numpy functions.\n",

Normalization is used to minimize variation coming from factors such as sample preparation inconsistencies, injection volume errors, and fluctuations in instrument sensitivity, which can happen with extended use (i.e. sensitivity drift with instrument cleanliness, or column age). By accounting for these variations, normalization allows for the comparison of biological variances rather than technical ones. Following normalization, imputation fills missing values with low abundance numbers that mimic the instrument's noise floor, allowing for statistical testing across conditions. Both normalization and imputation create a baseline from which conditions can be compared in a more robust way.\n"
