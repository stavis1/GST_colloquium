We've trimmed the data in our examples so that they run quickly, but keep in mind the relative speed increase will generally scale proportionally with the data size.

        "\n",
        "Hashmaps are data structures that store key-value pairs in a way that allows you to very quickly look up a value (some data) based on a key (the datorum label). Dictionaries in python are hashmaps which can store any object as a value and can use any hashable object as a key. Sets are specialized hashmaps which only store true or false as values. These can be used to efficiently look up whether or not a key is in the set. What does it mean for an object to be hashable? Essentially, the object has to be able to be converted into a number. This can be easily done for any combination of text/numbers. For example, the hash of 42 is 42, while the hash of \"GST colloquium\" is 1233321040512913595\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "More precisely, a hash is a function that maps objects of arbitrary size and complexity to a finite range of numbers. In the context of a hashmap data structure the finite range represents locations in memory and the hash function calculates where in memory a value is stored based on its key. This means that the time it takes to find a value is only dependent on the time it takes to calculate the hash of a key. This contrasts with looking up values in a list which requires iterating over each item in the list until you find what you're looking for, an operation that becomes more expensive on average as the list grows in size.\n",

Hashmap Data Call\" title=\"Figure 1: Accessing Data in a Hashmap\" width=\"440\" hspace=\"20\" vspace=\"10\"> The tradeoff that you have to make with hashmaps is that there are some cases in which two keys have the same hash so their values must be stored in a list and iterated over for lookup. To minimize this problem the range of memory locations needs to be significantly larger than the number of values stored. This means that hash maps will generally be larger in memory than more compact data structures like lists. This is not as much of a problem as it first appears because Python does not store the actual value at the memory locaiton calculated by the hash function. Instead the memory location it calculates is the index of a list that stores memory addresses which point to where the values are actually stored (see figure). This means that each block of memory indexed by the hashmap can be very small while still being able to point to values of arbitrary size. Therefore the memory overhead is only likely to be siginficant if you're storing a large number of small things.\n",

        "Hashmaps cannot solve all data lookup problems. If, for example, you wish to find the closest value to some query then that value's memory location cannot be directly computed with a hash function. Instead we can use an efficient search strategy for sorted lists called binary search. This algorithm starts by comparing the query against the middle value in the sorted list. If your query is larger than this value then we know that the target value is in the larger half of the list. We can then start the process over using just the larger half, meaning that we compare the query against the middle value in this new list and infer from that what half of the new list our target value must be in. This process continues until either the an exact match to the query is found or two adjacent numbers are found which bracket the query, meaning one is smaller and one is larger.\n",

Ideally, if we wish to run a function on a collection of inputs that have repeats what we would first do is collect only the unique inputs, run the function on those and then use a dictionary to map inputs to outputs for the whole collection. The code for doing this is somewhat tedious to write and requires the creation of several intermediate variables. A more elegant solution is to have the function itself build the dictionary of inputs and outputs as it is run. This way, if it sees a duplicate input it can skip evaluating the function and instead immediately return the saved output. This process is called <u>memoization</u>.\n",

        "Tabular data is often parsed in Python as Pandas dataframes. The Pandas package has a built-in reader for Excel files (.xlsx), but this is a rather slow process, especially for large files. This is because .xlsx files are actually zipped folders of mostly XML files which need to be decompressed before going through the somewhat inefficient process of XML parsing. This setup gives Excel the flexibility to store images, graphs, formatting, and functions. However, if all you want is a table of data, this flexibility comes at significant performance costs. It is therefore generally preferable to store tabular data as a text file (.csv or .tsv) unless you absolutely need to store these extra types of information.\n",

        "If you have no choice but to use large .xlsx files there is still a faster way to import the data as a pandas dataframe. The xlsx2csv package is sigificantly faster at parsing .xlsx files than pandas. So, what we can do is parse the .xlsx file to an in-memory .csv (meaning that the file is stored only in RAM and not written to our hard drive) then use the very efficient pandas .csv parser to get the data into a dataframe. This trick comes from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28766133/faster-way-to-read-excel-files-to-pandas-dataframe#comment136215400_28769537).\n"

In its original form (256,547 rows by 506 columns) pandas .read_excel() took 16 minutes to load the file, the Xlsx2csv trick took 7 minutes, and reading in the .tsv version of the file with pandas .read_csv() took 16 seconds. As you can see below, the shortened file is parsed by .read_excel() and Xlsx2csv about 10x faster. This remarkable increase in speed between the original document and its current version is not merely due to cutting the number of rows in half. Rather, there was significant formatting information included in the original export that was stripped during our file processing (converting .xlsx to .tsv back to .xlsx). We expect that these improvements are primarily due to the removed .xlsx formatting having massively complicated the XML representation of the data. This can be seen in the relatively modest improvement in load time for the tsv reader as compared to the impressive improvements for the two direct .xlsx readers.\n",

The optimizations include single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) steps in which a single operation that would normally be applied serially to values in an array can be applied simultaniously to blocks of 4-8 values. When doing mathematical operations it is therefore best to let numpy handle as much of the processing as possible.

Pandas provides a couple of tools to do this including .apply() and .iterrows(). Like much of pandas these tools are very flexable but they pay for that flexability with performance overhead. A faster solution is usually to apply your function using a list comprehension, which is a compact method of defining lists using loops in python that avoids the overhead associated with repeated calls to list.append(). What should at all costs be avoided is repeatedly accessing and/or modifying individual values in a dataframe using .at(), .loc[] or .iloc[].  "

        "Instruments and mass spec software pipelines often export data in a 'wide' format where all data about a specific analyte are found in a single row of a table and multiple replicate observations means multiple columns. In many cases, especially in the context of statisitcal packages, it is useful to represent data in a 'long' format (in the R ecosystem this is often called the tidy format). Pandas implements a very fast approach to doing this but the DIY approach to the problem would be to build up the long dataframe by iterating over replicate columns. When building a dataframe iteratively by pieces it is tempting to make repeated calls to pd.concat() or the now depreciated df.append(). There is a significant amount of overhead to these calls which makes that approach slow. If you need to build a dataframe by concatenating component pieces the best choice is to use pd.concat() once on a list of all the pices you wish to include.\n",

        "\n",
        "Most modern computers that we are likely to do any amount of bioinformatics on have a processor with more than one core, meaning they can process more than one instruction at a time. Python is not typically capable of taking advantage of this ability because it is constrained to run only one instruction at a time. This constriant has the advantage of making python code less prone to bugs and far easier to write, but sometimes we need the speed that parallelism provides. Python provides the multiprocessing package that provides a suite of tools for creating, running and communicating with multiple processes concurrently. A process is the in-memory representation of your code, associated data, and the instructions being run by the CPU.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There is a distinction to be made between logical and physical CPU cores. A physical core is a self-contained computational unit capable of carrying out all the tasks we expect of a CPU. Having multiple physical cores always means that you can do multiple computations at once. Some physical cores are capable of doing two computations at a time if, and only if, those two tasks are different, e.g. adding two numbers while bit shifting another. This capacity is represented by the OS as \"logical cores\". If you're doing many different tasks having two logical cores is almost as good as having two physical cores but if there is significant overlap in tasks there's much less of an advantage. Google colab has only a single physical core with two logical cores. This is not a good processor for demonstrating the advantages of multiprocessing so be aware that you can expect far more dramatic performance improvements on other systems than what you see here.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the ideal case, splitting up a task across N cores will run in 1/N the time that the task took to run serially. However, this is never achieved in practice because the parallelization process itself requires extra work to carry out. In python specifically there is a lot of extra work to be done because the entire interpreter (the program that reads and runs your code) needs to be duplicated for each process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, in order to communicate between processes, e.g. to pass inputs to or results from a paralellized function, the data need to be serialized into a string of bytes then unpacked at the other end. This process can be qite slow for very large variables like dataframes or arrays. On Linux (and google colab runs on Linux) there is a workaround for this. The default way for a new process to be created on Linux is for the child process to share its parent memory until one of the processes modifies a chunk of that memory, at which point only that chunk is copied into a process-specific memory pool. This means that any variables available in the global scope when a child process is created remains available to that child process. On other operating systems this behavior is simulated by re-running the script from the top in each child process which can have significant performance costs if you aren't careful.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the following examples we will be doing the same task as shown in §3.2.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TLDR:** Multiprocessing can dramatically reduce the run-speed of many programs. The catch is that passing large inputs to functions is quite slow.\n",

        "The multiprocesspandas package implements a drop-in replacement for the pandas .apply() called .apply_parallel() which allows you to easily apply a function to either rows or columns of a data frame in parallel. Parallelization reqires some amount of overhead so for simple functions that are fast to compute this overhead may result in the total runtime being longer than taking a serial approach. In these cases overhead can be minimized by trying different values for the n_chunks parameter, although the default should be ideal in most circumstances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Internally multiprocesspandas usess multiprocessing.pool so the considerations outlined in §4 apply here as well. Which, in light of colab only having 2 logical cores is why we see very little improvement from parallelization in this situation."
